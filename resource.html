      <td>Water</td>
      <td>Water is important for Blue Whales because sea mammals have a thick layer of blubber (Fat). And lack of water can cause the Blue Whale to overheat and get dehydrated.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Food</td>
      <td>Food is crucial for the survival of every animal. Food is needed for nutrients and for growth and repair of the body. “If you’re a very large animal, you have a lot of body mass that you have to  maintain,” says marine biologist Jeremy Goldbogen.<a href="https://www.amnh.org/content/download/322383/4992454/file/part-3-text-passage-student-version.pdf"target="_blank">(By Polly Shulman - American museum of natural history)</a></td>

    <tr>
      <td>Shelter/Protection</td>
      <td>Protection is important for Blue Whales because their waste is very rich in iron and is a major source of nutrients in the marine food chain, increasing productivity in the Southern Ocean, which boosts fishery yields <a href="https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/species/blue-whale/#:~:text=Blue%20whales%20require%20enormous%20amounts,productivity%2C%20which%20boosts%20fishery%20yields."target="_blank">(Blue Whale)</a></td>
