    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Climate Change</td>
      <td>Climate change is an indirect threat to Blue Whales because climate change has caused many disturbances in the Ocean. Below are some examples of it.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Breeding Winters </td>
      <td>Blue Whales usually breed during winter and spring in low latitudes to keep sperm viable. Climate change might affect their timing for migration and if they get their at the wrong time, they will not be able to reproduce.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>High Temperatures</td>
      <td>High temperature because of climate change can affect the pH of the area, populations of prey may shift their distribution, hence altering the Blue Whales migration patterns.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Carbon Dioxide (CO2)</td>
      <td>high temperatures reduce pH levels over time and cause Carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere. When CO2 is absorbed by the seawater, a series of chemical reactions happen, resulting in increased concentrations of Hydrogen ions. This causes the seawater to be more acidic. Ocean acidification disturbs krills growth, which can cause Blue Whales to starve. </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Melting ice</td>
      <td>Climate change has caused melting ice which effects the growth of plankton, the food of krills. And if krills do not get enough food, they would not grow and reproduce well and if krill does not reproduce, Blue whales will lose their only food source, resulting in them starving to death.</td>
