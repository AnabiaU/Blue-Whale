  <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
  <hr>
  <h1> Kingdom : Animalia</h1>
  <p1>This means that the Blue Whale belongs to a group that consists of all multicellular animals. </p1>
  <h1> Phylum : Chordata</h1>
    <p1> A phylum is a group of animals that share one or more of the same fundamental characteristics. Phylum Chordata is a group that consists of animals with a spinal cord and gill pouches</p1><a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/marine-mammal-taxonomy#:~:text=Most%20people%20call%20them%20by,specific%20species%20name%20(musculus)"
        target="_blank">(Fisheries, 2021)</a></p1>
  <h1> Class : Mammalia</h1>
  <p1> Blue whales are mammals</p1>
  <h1> Order : Cetacea</h1>
  <p1> A Cetacean is a marine mammal.</p1>
  <h1> Family : Balaenidae</h1>
  <p1> The Balaenidae family, also known as Rorqual Whales, have pleats around their throats, which helps them hold thousands of gallons of water and food <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/marine-mammal-taxonomy#:~:text=Most%20people%20call%20them%20by,specific%20species%20name%20(musculus)"
    target="_blank">(Fisheries, 2021)</a></p1> </p1>
  <h1> Genus : Balaenoptera</h1>
  <p1>A genus is a group of individuals that are more closely related to one another than any other members of the family. Individuals from balaenoptera usually have a long and slender body<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/blue-whale#:~:text=Blue%20whales%20have%20a%20long,than%20other%20blue%20whale%20subspecies."target="_blank">(Fisheries, 2023)</a></p1>
  
<h1> Species : musculus</h1>
  <p1> A species is a group of individuals that can succesfully reproduce with one another.</p1>

  <h2>Evolutionary History</h2>
  <p1>The ancestor of Blue Whales, Pakicetus, walked the Earth about 50 million years ago.</p1>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p1>Pakicetus is a four-legged, goat-shaped being that is believed to be one of the first Cetaceans. </p1>

<br> 
  <br>

  <p1>The Pakicetus usually lived on the edges of riverbanks and lakes. It spent time both in and out of water.</p1>

  <br> 
  <br>

  <p1>There was another species about 50 to 48 million years ago, the relatives of Packicetus, called Ambulocetus. It lived near water and also spent time in water and land. It used its tail and large flipper-like feet to swim.</p1>
  <br> 
  <br>

  <p1>About 40 to 33 million years ago, there was another one called Dorundon. It lived and gave birth underwater. It had flippers and tiny hind legs and was five metres long. </p1>
  <br> 
  <br>

  <p1>The Cetaceans, Pakicetus, Ambulocetus, and Dorundo, adapted to life in the water. The Dorundos evolved into whales about 34 million years ago. These whales developed of eating by having flatter skulls and feeding filters in their mouths.</p1>

  <p1>In this phylogenetic tree, It shows how Pakicetus dveloped over time and grew fins and flippers to live in water.</p1>

<h2>Life History And Ecology</h2>
  <p1>Blue Whales were first classified by a Swedish botanist named Carl Linnaeus in Southern Italy over 250 years ago. Their life expectency is about 80 - 90 years.   </p1>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p1>Blue Whales are found in all Oceans except the Arctic Ocean. They migrate to polar grounds to feed on Krill in the summer. Then they migrate to equatorial waters to breed in the Winter.</p1>

<h1>Biology</h1>
<p1>Blue Whales are the largest known mammals to live in Earth. They can grow up to 30m in length and can weigh 180,000kg according to <a href="https://www.bbcearth.com/news/how-earths-biggest-animal-started-small#:~:text=Far%20bigger%20than%20any%20dinosaur,or%202%2C670%20average%2Dsized%20men."target="_blank">(Shaw, How Earth's biggest animal started small)</a> At brith, the baby can weigh 5,000 to 6,000 pounds and can grow up to 23 feet in length. </p1>  
<br>
<br>

<h1>Special attributes</h1>

  <p1>Blue Whales breath through their blowholes, which are connected to their lungs. The blowholes are located on the top of their heads. Blue Whales have high efficient lungs that help them survive underwater and prevent them from constantly having to come to the surface for air. Because of this, Blue Whales are able to hold their breath for about 90 minutes. </p1>

  <h1>Resources needed for survival</h1>
  <p1>Food is the most important resource for Blue Whales. Blue Whales only feed on krill, thus making it the most important resource for survival. Blue Whales need krill to reproduce and recover their population<a href="https://usa.oceana.org/blue-whale-and-krill/#:~:text=Having%20been%20hunted%20to%20near,as%20blue%20whale%20feeding%20sites."target="_blank">(Blue Whale and krill)</a> They eat up to 6 tons a day. They need 1.5 million calories a day to meet their energy requirment.</p1>

  <p1>It food web starts from Krills, who are eaten by Blue Whales and Blue Whales are eaten by Orcas (Killer Whales). Sea Lions, Sardines, and Salmons are also eaten by Orcas. Sea Lions eat Sardines, Salmons, And Squids. Salmons eat Sardine and Squid. Squids eat Sardines and Krill. And Sardines and Krill feed off of Plankton, a group of organisms such as bacteria, algae, protozoans, etc. </p1>
