  <h2>Social and community issues </h2>
  <p1>There are many problems in the Ocean that are caused by climate change and too much plastic production. These problems are killing whales as well as harming the ecosystem because if blue whales go extinct, the krill which they feed on will multiply rapidly, which will deplete the planktons and algae which they feed on. The end result would be a destabilized aquatic food chain.</p1>

  <h1>Whaling</h1>
  <img src = "https://assets.ourworldindata.org/grapher/exports/whales-killed-per-decade.svg">
<br>
  <br>
  
  
  <p1>Whaling means to hunt and kill whales for their oil, meat, and whalebone. This has caused over 1,000 Whales to die every year <a href="https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/species/blue-whale/#:~:text=Blue%20whales%20require%20enormous%20amounts,productivity%2C%20which%20boosts%20fishery%20yields."target="_blank">(Blue Whale)</a> The <a href="https://www.animallaw.info/intro/whales#:~:text=Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act,regardless%20of%20their%20population%20status."target="_blank">Marine Mammal Protection Act(MMPA)</a> was passed by the United States Congress in 1972. This act makes it illegal to kill, hunt, injureq, harass, all species of marine mammals for a resident of United States. It also makes it illegal to import marine mammals or products made from them into the United States.</p1>

  <h1>Vessel Strikes</h1>
  <p1>A vessel strike is when a boat hits or collides with a marine animal in the ocean. An estimate of 20,000 whales are killed every year due to vessel strikes <a href="https://nautil.us/why-ships-kill-thousands-of-whales-every-year-381538/#:~:text=Yet%20an%20estimated%2020%2C000%20whales,even%20realize%20that%20it%27s%20happening."target="_blank">(Keim, Why ships kill thousands of whales every year 2023)</a> Fortunately, NOAA established a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/10/10/E8-24177/endangered-fish-and-wildlife-final-rule-to-implement-speed-restrictions-to-reduce-the-threat-of-ship"target="_blank">Mandatory vessel speed rule</a> in 2008 to lessen the impact of vessel strikes on whales. This rules states that all vessels longer that 65 feet should slow their speed in specific areas along the East Coast at certain times of the year. </p1>

  <h1>Plastic Pollution</h1>
  <p1>Every year, 400 million tons of plastic is produced and at least 14 million tons of plastic is dumped in the ocean. Marine animals usually mistake the plastic as food and swallow it, which ends up getting stuck in their stomack of breathing pipes and kills 100 million marine animals each year. The <a href="https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/about-our-program/marine-debris-act"target="_blank">Marine Debris Act</a> was signed into law in 2006 and requirs to "identify, determine sources of, assess, prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris and address the adverse impacts of marine debris on the economy of the United States, marine environment, and navigation safety."</p1>
